# dabulang
A simple imperative programming language with a BASIC-inspired syntax

## Getting started

The interpreter is written in haskell and uses cabal as the build system, so make sure these are installed on your system.
To build the project, clone the repo and run `cabal run dabulang -- test/test.dabu` which should execute the test script.
